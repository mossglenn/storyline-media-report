# Storyline Media Report

Generate a simple HTML or PDF report showing all media assets from an Articulate Storyline `.story` project PLUS thumbnails, alt text, and internal notes (from the Media Library).

## What It Does

- Extracts media assets from a `.story` file (which is just a ZIP archive).
- Matches media files by checksum with entries in `story/story.xml`.
- Collects:
  - Thumbnail of each image (resized)
  - Internal notes (from the `note` attribute)
  - Alt text (from `<altText>` tag)
- Outputs:
  - A compact, shareable **HTML** file
  - Or a printable **PDF report** (with poor layout so far 🤬)

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Pillow (`pip install Pillow`)
- FPDF2 (if generating PDF: `pip install fpdf`)

---

## How to Use
For HTML output:
```bash
python storyline_media_to_html.py "your_project.story"
```

For PDF output:
```bash
python storyline_media_to_pdf.py "your_project.story"
```

## Output

- storyline_media_report.html — Viewable in any browser.
- storyline_media_report.pdf — Portable format for documentation or reviews.

Each entry shows:

- A small image preview
- Alt text
- Internal note (entered using Storyline Media Library)

HTML output:  
<img width="400" alt="screenshot showing html output with image followed by alt text, followed by note text" class="recess" src="Screenshot_Storyline_Media_Report.png">
